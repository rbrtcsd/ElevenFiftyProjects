    <h1>Examples</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Div One</h2>
        <p>This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Let's have a little bit of fun today. It's all a game of angles. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. That's crazy.

            We'll play with clouds today. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. We'll make some happy little bushes here.
            
            I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper.</p>

        <h2> Div Two</h2>
        <p>This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. That's crazy. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Don't fight it, use what happens. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.

            Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.
            
            It's important to me that you're happy. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Fluff that up.</p>

        <h2>Div Three</h2>
        <p>Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Nothing wrong with washing your brush.

            We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy.
            
            Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too.</p>
